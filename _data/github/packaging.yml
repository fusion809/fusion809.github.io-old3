This repository as `-old` and `-old2` versions, which refer to old versions of this repository that have been discarded due to their size being unacceptable. To help keep its repository size down and make it easier to tag releases of individual packages I have split this repository into a series of submodules &mdash; one for each individual PKGBUILD."
