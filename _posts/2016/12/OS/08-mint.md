## Linux Mint
{% include_relative infoboxes/08-mint.html %}

[**Linux Mint**][800] is one of the most popular Linux distributions available (in fact according to [*DistroWatch*][801] it is the most popular Linux distribution). It is a [Ubuntu LTS][802] derivative that has two official editions: one with MATE (which is designed to be used by older computers) and another with Cinnamon, a desktop environment specifically developed by Linux Mint developers for use by Linux Mint. I have personally only ever tried Linux Mint in a VirtualBox VM, but from what I can tell it is very similar to Ubuntu, except it has some home-grown applications to make system management easier. The standard command-line upgrade mechanism of Ubuntu, I have been informed, does not reliably work with Linux Mint, namely running:

{% include Code/coder.html line1="do-release-upgrade" %}

does not reliably upgrade between releases of Linux Mint (e.g. it may not reliably upgrade a Linux Mint 17.3 system to 18.1). So this is one thing that may reduce this distribution's appeal to beginners. An upgrade guide for Linux Mint can be found [here][803].

### Closing remarks
It is ideal for users that:

* Like the Cinnamon/MATE desktop environments. Cinnamon is probably one of the most Windows-like desktop environments available for Linux, so Windows users may appreciate the similarities. The MATE edition of Linux Mint is also Windows-like in appearance. [Zorin OS][804] has a more Windows-like user interface, however, and is, like Linux Mint, based on Ubuntu LTS, so may be more suitable for those that like the Windows user interface. Those that want a similar, but macOS-like in appearance, distribution should probably use [deepin][805] or [elementary OS][806]. 
* Like a beginner-friendly operating system.
* Want a distribution with rather comprehensive software repositories (so that it is easier to install any piece of software you want).
* Favour a fairly conservative yet stable distribution, in terms of how up-to-date its software is.

It also has its own set of [official support forums][807], that I have never really had to use (hence I cannot really comment on their quality).
