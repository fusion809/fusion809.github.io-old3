**Different software**. You will not be able to take some of your applications with you when transitioning from Windows to Linux. Some applications run solely on Windows while others run only on Windows and OS X. Most [proprietary games](https://fusion809.github.io/glossary/#proprietary-software) you have run on Windows will not run on Linux, or if they do they will likely not run as well. The only real exception are games written in the Java programming language (for example, *RuneScape*), as they run on any Java-capable platform, including Linux. Some Windows applications can be run on Linux by use of emulation software such as VirtualBox and Wine. For further details see the [running Windows applications under Linux](#running-windows-apps) section. Most [free and open-source software](https://fusion809.github.io/glossary/#free-and-open-source-software) (FOSS), however, will run most natively on Linux.
