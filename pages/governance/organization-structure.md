Organizational structure
========================

Some countries comprise a union of many smaller partially self-governing regions under a central federal government; such countries are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Federation" link="federal states" f="b" %} (**federations**). These partially self-governing regions may be called, among other things, states, cantons or provinces. The alternative type of country is referred to as a {% include wp.html link="unitary state" f="b" %}, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. It is important to note that while some unitary states, like China, have regions referred to as provinces, these nations are still considered unitary as while these regions may be partially self-governing, the national government has supreme authority over the entire nation and has the ability to unilaterally dissolve the regional government at will and govern the region all by itself.

Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as {% include wp.html art="Devolution" link="devolved states" f="b" puncr="," %} with a classic example being the United Kingdom, and its self-governing regions of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Confederations are another organizational structure arrangement wherein sovereign nations voluntarily, usually by means of a treaty, agree to join together for the purpose of achieving common goals (e.g. defence against a common enemy) or for mutual benefit (e.g. for freer trade). One defining characteristic of a confederation is that these nations have full ability to secede from the union, should they choose. This is as opposed to federations, wherein secession is often not possible, e.g. take the example of Western Australia and its attempts in the 1930s to secede from the Commonwealth of Australia. It failed as the Constitution reads:

> WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,...

The keyword there is "indissoluble", meaning the union cannot be dissolved, it is fixed forever, hence preventing secession. Despite this, there is at least one example of a successful secession from a federation that I am aware of, that is, the secession of several "Soviet Socialist Republics" (essentially akin to states) from the former USSR not long before its complete dissolution in 1991.

Centuries ago, there was no clear distinction between a confederation and a federation, they were treated as being one in the same. This is why, while most political scientists would describe Switzerland as a federation&mdash;not a confederation&mdash;its name is still officially the Swiss Confederation.
