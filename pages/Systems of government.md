This article is more for my benefit than anyone else's, it is mostly so that I can write my thoughts and knowledge on the various systems of government. A recent interest of mine has been systems of government. 

Terminology
===========

There are **three branches**, or powers of government: the **legislative** branch (legislature), that creates, modifies and repeals laws; the **judicial** branch (judiciary/judicature), that interprets and applies the law; and, the **executive** branch that executes and enforces the law. In the presidential system of the US there is a fairly clean separation of these three branches, in an attempt to ensure a dictatorship cannot take hold.

A [**head of state**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) is the person who officially represents a [sovereign country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state), like at international meetings. They are usually either a [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch) or a [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President).

A [**head of government**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government) is the highest ranking official in the executive branch of a government (usually a president, premier, chancellor, prime minister or monarch), like of a federated state (e.g. Qld) or a sovereign nation.

A [**cabinet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)) (often spelt with a capital c) is a body of officials, usually referred to as secretaries or ministers, that are the top leaders of the executive branch of government.

A proposed law is called a [**bill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)) until it is passed by the legislature and written into law. Legislatures may comprise a single chamber wherein members vote on a bill as a single unit, or they may comprise multiple chambers (sometimes referred to as *houses*) that debate and vote separately and have different roles. Legislatures with a single chamber are usually referred to as [**unicameral**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism), while those with two chambers are called [**bicameral**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism). Historically, legislatures with more chambers have existed (e.g. a [three-chamber legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricameralism) existed for a time during late apartheid South Africa).

In bicameral legislatures one chamber is often called the lower house and the other, the upper house. Legislatures modelled after that of the UK usually have a far stronger lower house than upper house, while in others both have approximately equal power (e.g. the Australian Senate) and in others the upper house has some unique powers the lower house does not have (e.g. the US Senate). 

Upper houses are often not directly elected, which is the case for the Canadian Senate (wherein it comprises of people appointed by the PM to sit there), the German Bundesrat (which comprises delegates from the various states), the United States Senate (also comprised of delegates from the various states) and the United Kingdom House of Lords (which comprises bishops from the Church of England; people with a birthright to be there; and those appointed by the Queen on the advice of the PM or the Appointments Commission). Despite this, some are directly elected, such as the Australian Senate Senate. Members of the lower house of a bicameral legislature are almost always directly elected, as are members of the sole house of a unicameral legislature (e.g. the New Zealand House of Representatives).

<h2>Systems of government</h2>

The two main basic types of government in use around the world today are <b>monarchies</b> and <b>republics</b>. Neither of which have a perfectly all-encompassing definition, as what they are taken to mean can differ quite significantly between countries.

Under a monarchy, the head of state&mdash;the monarch&mdash;is an individual who usually inherits their role, and usually cannot be forcibly removed from their role, except due to incapacity. This person may also be the head of government and the country's supreme leader, which is the case in an absolute monarchy like Saudi Arabia. Most monarchies present in the world nowadays are constitutional monarchies wherein there are set rules, contained within a legal document called a constitution, that limits the monarch's power and that the monarch usually has little power to change on their own. Some constitutional monarchies of note include Commonwealth realms like Australia, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Japan. Constitutional monarchies are usually also democratic in their governance.

Under monarchy there are three main basic types:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" link="_blank">Absolute</a></b> &mdash; where the monarch has absolute power over every aspect of government. These were once more popular than they are now, as if the monarch abuses this power enough a coup d'état. Saudi Arabia and Oman are two notable examples of absolute monarchies that still exist today.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" link="_blank">Parliamentary constitutional</a></b> (<b>PCM</b>) &mdash; where the monarch has mostly ceremonial powers and most of the country's governance is done via democratic means. Notable examples of this include Commonwealth realms, several other European monarchies (e.g. the Netherlands and Norway), Japan and Malaysia.</li>
<li><b>Dual system constitutional</b> (DSCM) &mdash; where the monarch retains significant power, but there is still a parliament (often fairly weak) and constitutional limits on the monarch's power. The most notable example of this is Morocco. If one goes purely by what the constitution of Commonwealth realms says one would also have to consider Commonwealth realms as DSCMs, as they vest complete executive power in the monarch or their representative, along with some legislative powers (e.g. the power to give assent or not to legislation). Despite this theoretical power, the monarch/their representative almost always acts in accordance with the advice of elected officials, so in practice Commonwealth realms function more as PCMs.</li>
</ul>

Thailand is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy that has had its constitutional provisions for governance suspended and is presently under military dictatorship.

A republic is essentially every other type of government. The word "republic" derives from the Latin meaning "public thing", which means that the governance of the country is meant to be a public matter, not the private concern of the rulers. Despite this, many republics are not as democratic as this definition makes them sound, e.g. North Korea's official name is "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", despite it not being democratic at all.

Republics come in several different flavours (and yes, some republics have multiple different applicable adjectives) including:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic" link="_blank">Islamic</a></b> &mdash; republics ruled by Islamic laws. There are, at the time of writing, four Islamic republics in the world:

<ul>
<li>Afghanistan &mdash; follows a presidential system.</li>
<li>Iran &mdash; unique governance system that most closely resembles a presidential system.</li>
<li>Mauritania &mdash; otherwise government as a semi-presidential republic.</li>
<li>Pakistan &mdash; otherwise it is governed in a similar way to India, with a parliament vested with executive and legislative power and a separate judiciary.</li>
</ul></li>

<!-- Presidential -->

<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system" link="_blank">Presidential</a></b> &mdash; systems in which there is a popularly elected president that is both head of state and head of government, and there is a separate, largely independent legislature that is overseen by other elected officials (e.g. senators and congresspersons). The legislature has fairly minimal ability to affect the executive branch and vice versa, except via use of powers that are designed to only be used in exceptional circumstances (e.g. the legislature can often impeach the president, but it is challenging, likewise the president has the ability to veto any legislation that is pending approval). High ranking members of the judiciary are often appointed by the president, with the consent of the senate. The US is the prototypical presidential republic.

They tend to be relatively unstable, rank less well on measures of democracy (e.g. look at Turkey and Zimbabwe) and often end in a coup d'état, because of the difficulty in removing an unruly president and the difficulty in passing legislation when the president's political views differ from those of the legislature.</li>

<!-- Semi-presidential -->
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system" link="_blank">Semi-presidential</a></b> &mdash; systems where executive power is vested in both a popularly elected president and a cabinet (which includes its leader, the prime minister (PM)). The president appoints members of the Cabinet (ministers), under the advice of the PM (whom the president also appoints), but they are responsible to the legislature. The PM is usually a member of the legislature, but is not necessarily and leads the legislature. The president cannot dismiss the PM, but can dismiss other ministers under the PM's advice. Under this system the president is mostly concerned with foreign policy and defence, while the PM deals largely with domestic policy. France is the prototypical semi-presidential republic.

They seem to be particularly easy to abuse and turn into a dictatorship as they are present in countries that rank consistently near the bottom on measures of democracy (e.g. DRC, Russia), and was present in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic" link="_blank">Weimar Republic</a>, which preceded Nazi Germany.</li>

<!-- Parliamentary -->
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic" link="_blank">Parliamentary</a></b> &mdash; this is a common type of republic in Europe, wherein the legislative and executive branches are fused, as members of the executive branch are usually also members of legislature and are responsible to the legislature (which is called "parliament"). Many former PCMs that are now republics are parliamentary republics, which is the case for:

<ul>
<li>Botswana</li>
<li>India</li>
<li>Fiji</li>
<li>Iceland</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Myanmar</li>
<li>South Africa</li>
</ul>

Usually the executive head of government is called the prime minister and there is a largely ceremonial president (that basically serves the same roles as the Governor/Governor-General does in a PCM), but there are some such countries where the president is the head of government and there is no prime minister (e.g. Botswana, South Africa). When the president is ceremonial usually they are popularly elected (either directly, or by an electoral college), while if they are executive they are usually appointed by, and responsible to, the parliament.</li>

<!-- One-party -->
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_system" link="_blank">One-party</a></b> &mdash; these are usually Marxist-Leninist states, like what was present in the USSR, and is now in place in China, Vietnam and Laos. They are authoritarian states wherein all, or almost all, authority is vested in a single political party, which is the only party that legally can be in charge. These parties usually hold to a single ideology and if they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism-Leninism" link="_blank">Marxist-Leninist</a> their stated goal is to one day achieve Marxist communism. They do this by imposing state capitalism, wherein most businesses are state-owned and operated for the state's profit so that they can develop their capitalist economy and create a state of abundance. Under Marxist thought communism can only be achieved in a state of abundance and this is why they implement state capitalism despite claiming to be socialist. China's economy is presently the second fastest growing in the world after India and has not experienced negative growth (i.e. a recession) since the 1970s and their GDP (PPP) is presently the highest in the world.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organizational structure</h2>

{% include_relative governance/image-with-caption.html text="Figure 1: Federal and unitary states of the world" img="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg" width="60%" %}

Some countries comprise a union of many smaller partially self-governing regions under a central federal government; such countries are referred to as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation" link="_blank">federal states</a></b> (<b>federations</b>). These partially self-governing regions may be called, among other things, states, cantons or provinces. The alternative type of country is referred to as a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state" link="_blank">unitary state</a></b>, where there is a national government that has ultimate authority in the land. It is important to note that while some unitary states, like China, have regions referred to as provinces, these nations are still considered unitary as while these regions may be partially self-governing, the national government has supreme authority over the entire nation and has the ability to unilaterally dissolve the regional government at will and directly govern the region itself.<br/><br/>

Unitary states that voluntarily delegate some self-governance to subnational (e.g. provincial) governments are referred to as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution" link="_blank">devolved states</a></b>, with a classic example being the United Kingdom, and its self-governing regions of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.<br/><br/>

Confederations are another organizational structure arrangement wherein sovereign nations voluntarily, usually by means of a treaty, agree to join together for the purpose of achieving common goals (e.g. defence against a common enemy) or for mutual benefit (e.g. for freer trade). One defining characteristic of a confederation is that these nations have full ability to secede from the union, should they choose. This is as opposed to federations, wherein secession is often not possible, e.g. take the example of Western Australia and its attempts in the 1930s to secede from the Commonwealth of Australia. It failed as the Constitution reads:<br/><br/>

<blockquote>WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,...</blockquote><br/>

The keyword there is "indissoluble", meaning the union cannot be dissolved, it is fixed forever, hence preventing secession. Despite this, there is at least one example of a successful secession from a federation that I am aware of, that is, the secession of several "Soviet Socialist Republics" (essentially akin to states) from the former USSR not long before its complete dissolution in 1991.<br/><br/>

Centuries ago, there was no clear distinction between a confederation and a federation, they were treated as being one in the same. This is why, while most political scientists would describe Switzerland as a federation&mdash;not a confederation&mdash;its name is still officially the Swiss Confederation.
